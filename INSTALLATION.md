# Installation
## First launch
Download `Virtual_Succubus_Universal.dmg` at [GitHub](https://github.com/Ferbez/virtual-succubus-macos/releases/tag/1.2) and move Virtual Succubus app anywhere you want - preferably to Applications folder. Now open it. A window should pop up - asking for a game archive. Download Windows version of Virtual Succubus and choose it inside that window.

<br />
After that confirmation window should appear. That's all - now just open Virtual Succubus again and you're good to go!

# Update
Just delete old Virtual Succubus app and replace it with a new one. Don't worry - all your saves are still intact. You'll however need to set your password once again.
