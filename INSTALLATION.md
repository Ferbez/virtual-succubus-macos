# Installation
Download Virtual Succubus.dmg [here](https://github.com/Ferbez/virtual-succubus-macos/releases/tag/1.2) and Game Porting Toolkit 1.0 [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=game%20porting%20toolkit). Mount both of those .dmg files and extract Virtual Succubus anywhere you want - preferably to Applications folder. Now open it. A window asking for a Game Porting Toolkit should appear - choose it inside that window, as shown on screenshot.

After some time another window should pop up - this time asking for a game archive. Download Windows version of VS and choose it inside that window.

<br />
After that confirmation window should appear. That's all - now just open Virtual Succubus again and you're good to go!

# Update
Just delete old Virtual Succubus app and replace it with a new one. Don't worry - all your saves are still intact. You'll however need to set your password once again.
