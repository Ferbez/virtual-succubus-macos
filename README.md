# Virtual Succubus - now without (almost) any issues on macOS!
Like most of you, I really like VS, but I don't have Android device nor Windows PC, so playing it was always some kind of challenge for me. And while getting VS to run on Linux don't take too much effort, on macOS it's pretty different story - beginning with lack of proper Vulkan support and finishing with some crucial bugs in Wine itself. However, after playing around with Wine for a couple of days I've got VS working perfectly on macOS!

Both demo and full release work - this wrapper was tested on M1 MacBook Air 2020 with VS 0.39, however previous versions of the game should also work.

Since this wrapper uses Game Porting Toolkit, Apple Silicon Mac with macOS 13.4+ is required.

## Download and install
You'll need Windows version of VS and latest build of this wrapper, which you can download [here](https://github.com/Ferbez/virtual-succubus-macos/releases). Detailed installation guide is available [here](https://github.com/Ferbez/virtual-succubus-macos/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).
